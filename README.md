# TruthLens

See Through the Noise.

TruthLens is an AI-powered platform designed to detect misinformation in news articles, images, and videos.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision to analyze the credibility of media, assigning an authenticity score and an explanation that helps users understand why content is flagged as genuine or misleading.

ðŸš€ Current Focus â€” MVP (Phase 1)

The goal for this phase is to build a text-only prototype of TruthLens.

Users will be able to:

- Paste or type a news article.

- Receive an authenticity score (0â€“1) and a short verdict message.

- View a brief explanation of why the model made that judgment.

ðŸ§  Focus now: Implementing text analysis using a pretrained NLP model (BERT or RoBERTa) and connecting it to a simple React interface via FastAPI.
