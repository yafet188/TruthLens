**TruthLens** – AI-Powered Media & Information Authenticity Platform

Last Updated: Wedesday, December 17, 2025

1. Introduction and Scope

TruthLens (“TruthLens,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to safeguarding user privacy and ensuring responsible handling of information. This Privacy Policy describes how information is collected, processed, used, stored, and protected when you access or use the TruthLens platform, website, application, APIs, or related services (collectively, the “Service”).

This Privacy Policy forms an integral part of, and should be read in conjunction with, the TruthLens Terms of Service. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described herein.

2. Privacy-First Design Philosophy

TruthLens is architected around the principle of data minimization. The Service is designed to function without the need to retain personally identifiable information or long-term storage of user-submitted content.

Where possible, data is:
Processed ephemerally
Analyzed in real time
Discarded immediately after fulfillment of its intended purpose

TruthLens does not operate as a data brokerage service and does not sell or monetize user data.

3. Information We Collect

3.1 User-Submitted Content

When you use the Service, you may voluntarily submit content for analysis, including:
Text (e.g., articles, posts, statements)
Images
Videos

Such content is referred to as “User Submissions.”

TruthLens does not require users to submit personal information within User Submissions, and users are strongly discouraged from uploading sensitive personal data.

3.2 Technical and Usage Information

We may automatically collect limited technical information necessary for service operation, including:
Device type
Browser type
Operating system
IP address (temporarily, for security and abuse prevention)
Timestamps and session metadata

This information is collected in an aggregated or transient manner and is not used to identify individual users.

3.3 Account Information (If Applicable)

If account creation is enabled, we may collect:
Email address
Username or account identifier

Account information is used solely for authentication, service access, and user-initiated communication.

4. How We Use Information

TruthLens processes information strictly for legitimate and limited purposes, including:
Generating AI-based authenticity analyses
Displaying Analysis Results to users
Maintaining platform security and integrity
Preventing abuse, fraud, or malicious activity
Improving system performance using aggregated and anonymized insights

TruthLens does not use User Submissions for advertising, behavioral profiling, or targeted marketing.

5. AI Processing and Automated Analysis

User Submissions are processed by automated systems utilizing machine learning models, including natural language processing and computer vision techniques.

All analysis is:
Automated
Non-human reviewed by default
Statistical and probabilistic in nature

TruthLens does not make automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning users.

6. Data Retention and Deletion

6.1 User Submissions

User Submissions are processed in real time and are not permanently stored.

Temporary retention may occur:
In volatile memory
In short-term system caches
For debugging, security, or abuse detection

Such data is automatically deleted once no longer necessary, typically within a short and reasonable time frame.

6.2 Logs and Diagnostics

System logs may be retained for a limited duration to:
Monitor system health
Investigate errors
Ensure platform security

Logs are minimized, anonymized where feasible, and periodically purged.

7. Use of Data for Model Improvement

TruthLens does not use identifiable User Submissions to train or fine-tune AI models by default.

Any future use of data for model improvement would:
Be aggregated and anonymized
Exclude personally identifiable information
Be clearly disclosed prior to implementation

8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

TruthLens may use limited cookies or similar technologies for:
Session management
Security
Basic analytics

We do not deploy invasive tracking mechanisms or third-party advertising cookies.

9. Third-Party Service Providers

TruthLens may rely on trusted third-party providers for:
Cloud hosting
Infrastructure
Analytics
Security monitoring

These providers are granted access only to the information necessary to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to adhere to confidentiality and data protection standards.

10. Data Security

TruthLens employs reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and users acknowledge inherent risks associated with digital data transmission and processing.

11. User Rights and Choices

Depending on jurisdiction, users may have rights to:
Request information regarding data handling
Request deletion of account information (if applicable)
Object to certain processing activities

Requests may be submitted using the contact information provided below.

12. Children’s Privacy

The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. TruthLens does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

13. International Use and Data Transfers

TruthLens may operate infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions. By using the Service, you consent to the processing of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, regardless of geographic location.

14. Changes to This Privacy Policy

TruthLens reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be reflected by a revised “Last Updated” date.

Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of any changes.

15. Relationship to Terms of Service
